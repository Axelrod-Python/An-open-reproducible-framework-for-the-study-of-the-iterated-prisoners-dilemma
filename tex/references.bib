abstract = {The reproduction and replication of reported scientific results is a hot topic within the academic community. The retraction of numerous studies from a wide range of disciplines, from climate science to bioscience, has drawn the focus of many commentators, but there exists a wider socio-cultural problem that pervades the scientific community. Sharing code, data and models often requires extra effort; this is currently seen as a significant overhead that may not be worth the time investment. Automated systems, which allow easy reproduction of results, offer the potential to incentivise a culture change and drive the adoption of new techniques to improve the efficiency of scientific exploration. In this paper, we discuss the value of improved access and sharing of the two key types of results arising from work done in the computational sciences: models and algorithms. We propose the development of an integrated cloud-based system underpinning computational science, linking together software and data repositories, toolchains, workflows and outputs, providing a seamless automated infrastructure for the verification and validation of scientific models and in particular, performance benchmarks.},

The object is to gain a deeper understanding of how to perform well in such a setting. The 62 entrants were able to draw lessons from the results of the first round and were able to design their entries to take these lessons into account. The results of the second round demonstrate a number of subtle pitfalls which specific types of decision rules can encounter. The winning rule was once again TIT FOR TAT, the rule which cooperates on the first move and then does what the other player did on the previous move. The analysis of the results shows the value of not being the first to defect, of being somewhat forgiving, but also the importance of being provocable. An analysis of hypothetical alternative tournaments demonstrates the robustness of the results.},

TFT placed 8th, probably due to its provocability which, in the presence of noise, causes it to fall into unintended vendettas with other cooperative, but provocable, strategies.

abstract = {Intelligence pertains to the ability to make appropriate decisions in light of specific goals and to adapt behavior to meet those goals in a range of environments. Mathematical games provide a framework for, studying intelligent behavior in models of real-world settings or restricted domains. The behavior of alternative strategies in these games is defined by each individual's stimulus-response mapping. Limiting these behaviors to linear functions of the environmental conditions renders the results to be little more than a facade: effective decision making in any complex environment almost always requires nonlinear stimulus-response mappings The obstacle then comes in choosing the appropriate representation and learning algorithm. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms provide useful means for addressing these issues. This paper describes efforts to hybridize neural and evolutionary computation to learn appropriate strategies in zero- and nonzero-sum,games, including the iterated prisoner's dilemma, tic-tac-toe, and checkers. With respect to checkers, the evolutionary algorithm was able to discover a neural network that can be used to play at a near-expert level without injecting expert knowledge about how To play the game. The implications of evolutionary learning with respect to machine intelligence ale also discussed. It is argued that evolution provides the framework for explaining naturally occuring intelligent entities and can be used to design machines that are also capable of intelligent behavior.},

ABSS research can contribute greatly to the understanding of social phenomena, but needs to be based on clear appreciation of the current "state of play" in the areas where it is used. With regard to "thin" (simple, general) simulation models, this primarily means attending to what has been or could be discovered by mathematical analysis, to work using other forms of simulation, and to the relevant theoretical disputes; with regar to "thick" (specific, detailed) models (about which the paper has less to say), linking to the relevant "thin" models and to the empirical evidence. The bulk of ABSS work on social dilemmas has beel concentrated in quite a narrow, though certainly significant - area (reciprocal altruism in the Prisoner's Dilemma), and has sometimes been seriously flawer by aver-ambitious claims, and insufficient attention to analytical approaches - although this same work has been very fertile in terms of insipiring further work, both analytical and simulation based.},

abstract = {This paper is an introduction to agent-based simulation using the Python programming language. The core objective of the paper is to enable students, teachers, and researchers immediately to begin social-science simulation projects in a general purpose programming language. This objective is facilitated by design features of the Python programming language, which we very briefly discuss. The paper has a tutorial component, in that it is enablement-focused and therefore strongly application-oriented. As our illustrative application, we choose a classic agent-based simulation model: the evolutionary iterated prisoner's dilemma. We show how to simulate the iterated prisoner's dilemma with code that is simple and readable yet flexible and easily extensible. Despite the simplicity of the code, it constitutes a useful and easily extended simulation toolkit. We offer three examples of this extensibility: we explore the classic result that topology matters for evolutionary outcomes, we show how player type evolution is affected by payoff cardinality, and we show that strategy evaluation procedures can affect strategy persistence. Social science students and instructors should find that this paper provides adequate background to immediately begin their own simulation projects. Social science researchers will additionally be able to compare the simplicity, readability, and extensibility of the Python code with comparable simulations in other languages.},

@article{Kalai1988,
abstract = {A measure of complexity for repeated games strategies is studied. This measure facilitates the investigation of some issues regarding finite rationality and the structure of subgame perfect equilibria of repeated games with discounting. Specifically, the complexity of a strategy in a given repeated game is defined to be the cardinality of the induced strategy set, i.e., the number of distinct strategies induced by the original strategy in all possible subgames. We observe that this cardinality is equal to the size (cardinality of the state set) of the smallest automaton which can implement the strategy. Thus, in a sense, complexity is measured on the basis of the amount of computing power inherent in the strategy. A measure of strategic memory is also studied. The following results are obtained: (1) combining tow notions of "bounded rationality" (epsilon equilibrium and finite complexity), we find that every subgame perfect equilibrium of the repeated game can be approximated (with regard to payoffs) by a subgame perfect epsilon equilibrium of finite complexity. (2) For a generic class of normal form stage games, at every discount robust subgame perfect (DRSP) equilibrium, there are necessary relationships among the complexities and memories of the players' strategies. In the two player case, strategies must be equally complex and must have equal memories. (3) For a second class of two player stage games, we show that the payoff vectors for all DRSP equilibria are obtainable via equilibria in which the players' strategies are equally complex and have equal memories.},

In particular, a player X who is witting of these strategies can (i) deterministically set her opponent Y's score, independently of his strategy or response, or (ii) enforce an extortionate linear relation between her and his scores. Against such a player, an evolutionary player's best response is to accede to the extortion.

According to the IPD framework, repeated play (repetition) and reciprocity combine to maintain a cooperative equilibrium. However, experimental studies with animals suggest that cooperative behavior in IPDs is unstable, and some have suggested that strong preferences for immediate benefits (that is, temporal discounting) might explain the fragility of cooperative equilibria. We studied the effects of discounting and strategic reciprocity on cooperation in captive blue jays. Our results demonstrate an interaction between discounting and reciprocity. Blue jays show high stable levels of cooperation in treatments with reduced discounting when their opponent reciprocates, but their levels of cooperation decline in all other treatment combinations. This suggests that stable cooperation requires both reduced discounting and reciprocity, and it offers an explanation of earlier failures to find cooperation in controlled payoff games.},

abstract = {Self-serving, rational agents sometimes cooperate to their mutual benefit. However, when and why cooperation emerges is surprisingly hard to pin down. To address this question, scientists from diverse disciplines have used the Prisoner's Dilemma, a simple two-player game, as a model problem. In PNAS, Press and Dyson (1) dramatically expand our understanding of this classic game by uncovering strategies that provide a unilateral advantage to sentient players pitted against unwitting opponents. By exposing these results, Press and Dyson have fundamentally changed the viewpoint on the Prisoner's Dilemma, opening a range of new possibilities for the study of cooperation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFor nearly a century now game theory has influenced the way we think about the world. It has entered into the study of almost every type of human interaction, including economics, political science, war games, and evolutionary biology. This is because, at its core, game theory seeks to explain how rational players should behave to best serve their own interests. Game theory emerged as a field of active research with the work of John von Neumann on mathematical economics (2, 3). John Nash built on this foundation when he introduced the concept of a Nash Equilibrium (4), which occurs when no player can gain by unilaterally changing strategy. The impact of Nash's work, which began with economics, was soon felt in evolutionary biology, when John Maynard Smith and George Price introduced a variant form of equilibrium, the evolutionary stable strategy (5), which, when dominant in an evolving population, cannot be invaded and replaced by any other strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe Prisoner's Dilemma itself is well established as a way to study the emergence of cooperative behavior. Each player is simultaneously offered two options: to cooperate or defect. If both players cooperate, they each receive the same payoff, R; if both defect, they \{\ldots\}},

@article{Boyd1987,
abstract = {A knowledge of the conditions under which natural selection can favour cooperative behaviour among unrelated individuals is crucial for understanding the evolution of social behaviour, particularly among humans and other social mammals. In an influential series of works, Axelrod has argued that reciprocal cooperation is likely to evolve when individual organisms interact repeatedly. This conclusion is based, in part, on an evolutionary analysis of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game which indicates that strategies which lead to reciprocal cooperation are evolutionarily stable. In this paper, however, we argue that no pure strategy can be evolutionarily stable in this game. This fact casts doubt on several of Axelrod's conclusions about the evolution of reciprocity.},
